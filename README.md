Deliverable-4
=============
This deliverable is testing an web application implemented with Node.js and MongoDB.

The source app was forked from https://github.com/ccoenraets/nodecellar.

The test suite I developed uses the Mocha framework.

To run the app, in the nodecellar-master directory:

> (1) npm install: install all required modules;

> (2) node server: start server on port 3000

To run the test, in the test directory: 

> mocha wines: run the test suite with Mocha
